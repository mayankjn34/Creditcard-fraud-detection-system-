# Credit card fraud detection system  

This project is made to  use the machine learning technique to find credit card frauds in a tracsaction data. It uses a data set of credit card frauds to train the system using gaussian probability distribution sos as to find anomaly into the dats and flag it as a potential fraud

## Getting Started

This repository contains the code witten in python on a jupyter notebook and a csv data set.

### Prerequisites

install jupyter notebook
link contains the guide to install the notebook
```

```

## Dataset discription

The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions

### Trainig model

this repository contains the dataset : creditcard.csv
Code to train the machine on this data as well as evaluating with two algoriths
1. gaussian multivariate probability distribution :multivariate gaussian.ipynb
2. gaussian bi - variate probabilty sistrbution : Gaussian(single variate).ipynb
